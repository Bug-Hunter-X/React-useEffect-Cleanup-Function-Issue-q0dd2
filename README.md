This repository demonstrates a common issue in React's `useEffect` hook: improper handling of the cleanup function. The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code, where the cleanup function is not effectively managing resources when the component unmounts. This can lead to memory leaks or unexpected behavior.

The solution, provided in `bugSolution.js`, addresses this by ensuring the cleanup function is correctly implemented to prevent resource leaks and improve the overall stability and performance of the component.
